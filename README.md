## Requirements

### Your project must:

- Follow the theme you were given in class

- Have a funny/interesting/unique storyline

- Make use of the Python techniques we have studied so far, e.g. FOR loops and variables

## Extra Help

### Clearing the screen


  `from os import system  `
  `clear = lambda : system("clear") # place at the top of your code`


You can now run the `clear()` function whenever you want to clear the terminal screen.

### Adding a time delay


  `from time import sleep`

You can now call `sleep(n)` - where `n` is the number of seconds delay - to slow down the execution of your program (and therefore, the speed of your animation).
